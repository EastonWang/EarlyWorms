This is a binary classification problem, which aims to predict dropout probability in MOOC.

We develop our who project based on python scikit-learn toolkit. Most of the basic classifier models, such as LR, DT, SVM and ensemble models like RF, GBRT are included in our program. Our final version adopted the GBRT model.

To select feature, we also employ the PCA algorithm but make little improvement on the final score.
