### This is the repository for the KDD Cup 2015 contest.

In this contest we are required to solve a binary classification problem --- predicting dropout probability in MOOC.

We develop our whole project based on python scikit-learn toolkit. Most of the basic classifier models, such as LR, DT, SVM and ensemble models like RF, GBRT are included in our program. Our final version adopted the GBRT model.

To select feature, we also adopted the PCA algorithm but this algorithm made little improvement on the final score (AUC metric).
